The Steps to space optimize the tabulation approach are as follows:
- Declare a 2D vector 'ahead' initialized to 0 (base condition) and another 2D vector 'cur' also set to 0.
- Then initialize three nested loops to calculate the 'cur' arrayâ€™s values. Replace dp[ind] with 'cur' and dp[ind+1] with ahead in our tabulation code.
- After the inner loop execution, set 'ahead' as 'cur' for the next outer loop iteration. At last, return ahead[0][2] as our answer.

vector<vector<int>> ahead(2, vector<int>(3, 0));
vector<vector<int>> cur(2, vector<int>(3, 0));
